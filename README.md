# Elixir of Life

Implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Elixir. Cells are colored, and when new cells are spawned, they take on the average color of their ancestors. The rules of when cells die or are spawned are unchanged, though.

## Installation

Requires Elixir and an Erlang distribution with wxWidgets bindings. On macOS, you can get all that with just `brew install elixir`.

## Usage

Simulate a randomly seeded game:

```shell
mix run
```

## Development

### Lint & run tests

```shell
mix format
mix test --no-start
```
### Overview of files

Server:
* [`Grid`](lib/grid.ex) contains the logic for creating and iterating on a game of life. Some common patterns such as blocks and gliders can be constructed from the [`Grid.Patterns`](lib/patterns.ex) module
* Grids are composed of [`Cells`](lib/cell.ex), which can have traits such as a [`Color`](lib/color.ex) which get crossed when new cells are spawned
* The [`wx_view`](lib/wx_view/) folder contains code to display a game of life in a window powered by wxWidgets
* The [`Controller`](lib/controller.ex) repeatedly iterates a game of life, and visualizes it in a view
* â€¦ whereas the [`App`](lib/app.ex) is the app entry point where the game seed gets constructed
